Hi! This is just me being bored over the summer. 
I made a little map generator that I may or may not use to help me with stuff like D&D world
creation. 

I made it using vanilla js, html, and css
I used a Lindenmeyer system (Lsystem) for no particular reason besides
I thought it'd be cool. This was mostly just practice for me so I could 
work on my html, css, js, and github learning and application.
